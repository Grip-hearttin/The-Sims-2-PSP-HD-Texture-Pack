A texture pack for *The Sims 2(PSP)* made for the PPSSPP emulator

This project was started to remake the UI and make it more pleasant to look at. I will be gradually adding more textures.
Higher resolution textures have been imported from the PC version or remade by hand if there is no equivalent to be found.
